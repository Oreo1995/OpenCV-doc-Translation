接下来的教程是一系列基础OpenCV教程的集合。所有的源代码都是从OpenCV常规发行版本中提取出来的，所以在你只是简单的复制粘贴之前先检查一下。这些教程都是从我们的Git仓库中的reST文件中生成的。

我们一如既往地期待大家的反馈，并希望大家对这些教程提供帮助。（经查阅核实，Introduction to OpenCV中关于编译方法的内容已经过时，为保证质量，不翻译。请自行百度谷歌解决。或自行翻译后核对官方提供的步骤。比如Android部分仍然使用的是Eclipse ADT，而官方早已淘汰。）

* 介绍OpenCV

你将知道如何在你的电脑上安装OpenCV。

* The Core Functionality (core module)

Here you will learn about the basic building blocks of this library. A must read for understanding how to manipulate the images on a pixel level.

* Image Processing (imgproc module)

In this section you will learn about the image processing (manipulation) functions inside OpenCV.

* High Level GUI and Media (highgui module)

This section contains valuable tutorials on how to use the built-in graphical user interface of the library.

* Image Input and Output (imgcodecs module)

These tutorials show how to read and write images using imgcodecs module.

* Video Input and Output (videoio module)

These tutorials show how to read and write videos using videio module.

* Camera calibration and 3D reconstruction (calib3d module)

Although most of our images are in a 2D format they do come from a 3D world. Here you will learn how to find out 3D world information from 2D images.

* 2D Features framework (feature2d module)

Learn about how to use the feature points detectors, descriptors and matching framework found inside OpenCV.

* Video analysis (video module)

Here you will find algorithms usable on your video streams like motion extraction, feature tracking and foreground extractions.

* Object Detection (objdetect module)

Ever wondered how your digital camera detects people's faces? Look here to find out!

* Deep Neural Networks (dnn module)

These tutorials show how to use dnn module effectively.

* Machine Learning (ml module)

Use the powerful machine learning classes for statistical classification, regression and clustering of data.

* Graph API (gapi module)

Learn how to use Graph API (G-API) and port algorithms from "traditional" OpenCV to a graph model.

* Computational photography (photo module)

Use OpenCV for advanced photo processing.

* Images stitching (stitching module)

Learn how to create beautiful photo panoramas and more with OpenCV stitching pipeline.

* GPU-Accelerated Computer Vision (cuda module)

Squeeze out every little computational power from your system by utilizing the power of your video card to run the OpenCV algorithms.

* OpenCV iOS

Run OpenCV and your vision apps on an iDevice

Here you will learn the about the basic building blocks of the library. A must read and know for understanding how to manipulate the images on a pixel level.

Mat - The Basic Image Container

Compatibility: > OpenCV 2.0

Author: Bernát Gábor

You will learn how to store images in the memory and how to print out their content to the console.

How to scan images, lookup tables and time measurement with OpenCV

Compatibility: > OpenCV 2.0

Author: Bernát Gábor

You'll find out how to scan images (go through each of the image pixels) with OpenCV. Bonus: time measurement with OpenCV.

Mask operations on matrices

Languages: C++, Java, Python

Compatibility: > OpenCV 2.0

Author: Bernát Gábor

You'll find out how to scan images with neighbor access and use the cv::filter2D function to apply kernel filters on images.

Operations with images

Languages: C++, Java, Python

We will learn how to blend two images!

Changing the contrast and brightness of an image!

Languages: C++, Java, Python

Compatibility: > OpenCV 2.0

Author: Ana Huamán

We will learn how to change our image appearance!

Discrete Fourier Transform

Languages: C++, Java, Python

Compatibility: > OpenCV 2.0

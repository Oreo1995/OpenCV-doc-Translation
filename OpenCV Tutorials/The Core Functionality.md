本教程将会告诉你OpenCV中最基本的构件。在对图像进行像素级的处理之前，你必须对本教程进行通读。

Mat - 基础图形容器

Compatibility: > OpenCV 2.0

Author: Bernát Gábor

你将学会如何将图片保存到内存中，并如何打印到电脑终端上。

How to scan images, lookup tables and time measurement with OpenCV

Compatibility: > OpenCV 2.0

Author: Bernát Gábor

You'll find out how to scan images (go through each of the image pixels) with OpenCV. Bonus: time measurement with OpenCV.

Mask operations on matrices

Languages: C++, Java, Python

Compatibility: > OpenCV 2.0

Author: Bernát Gábor

You'll find out how to scan images with neighbor access and use the cv::filter2D function to apply kernel filters on images.

Operations with images

Languages: C++, Java, Python

Compatibility: > OpenCV 2.0

Reading/writing images from file, accessing pixels, primitive operations, visualizing images.

Adding (blending) two images using OpenCV

Languages: C++, Java, Python

Compatibility: > OpenCV 2.0

Author: Ana Huamán

We will learn how to blend two images!

Changing the contrast and brightness of an image!

Languages: C++, Java, Python

Compatibility: > OpenCV 2.0

Author: Ana Huamán

We will learn how to change our image appearance!

Discrete Fourier Transform

Languages: C++, Java, Python

Compatibility: > OpenCV 2.0

Author: Bernát Gábor

You will see how and why use the Discrete Fourier transformation with OpenCV.

File Input and Output using XML and YAML files

Compatibility: > OpenCV 2.0

Author: Bernát Gábor

You will see how to use the cv::FileStorage data structure of OpenCV to write and read data to XML or YAML file format.

How to use the OpenCV parallel_for_ to parallelize your code

Compatibility: >= OpenCV 2.4.3

You will see how to use the OpenCV parallel_for_ to easily parallelize your code.
